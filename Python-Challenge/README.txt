I borrowed some code from day 2 Python activities Ins_ReadCSV:Solved and Ins_WriteCSV:Solved

AskBCS Assistants:
jsun(Vivien) helped me fix an error I had with my files (apparently I had phantom files)
iturner(Ian) Explained how to use a file path (csv_path = 'PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv')
davefriedman(Dave) thoroughly explained key concepts
brandonwong(Brandon) helped clean up my script (PyPoll)
kpin(Kat) she thoroughly explained python functions/syntax and helped me figure out the logic of my code (PyPoll)
sdludla(Sandile) They helped me with the math part of my code (The total votes and the percentage) (PyPoll)
jleverenz(Jonathan) Helped me figure out the For loop for looping through the candidates on the CSV file (PyPoll)
rperron(Robert) Helped me fix an error I had with the file path. They also helped me fix an error with my textfile (PyPoll)
monalipatel(Monali) Was a massive help with the PyBank script. She helped me rewrite my script and gave me a new method of calculating costs such as:

# greatest_increase = ["",0]
# greatest_decrease = ["", 9999999999999999999]

#         if netchange > greatest_increase[1]:
#             greatest_increase[0] = row[0]
#             greatest_increase[1] = netchange
#         if netchange < greatest_decrease[1]:
#             greatest_decrease[0] = row[0]
#             greatest_decrease[1] = netchange

#     f"Greatest Increase in Profits: {greatest_increase[0]} (${greatest_increase[1]})\n"
#     f"Greatest Decrease in Profits: {greatest_decrease[0]} (${greatest_decrease[1]})\n"
